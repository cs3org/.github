Copyright and license policy
============================

License
-------
All released source code should by default be licensed under Apache 2.0 License.
Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis.

Tracking copyright
------------------
**Copyright statements**

Copyright statements must be included in:

- ``LICENSE`` file in the root of the repository.
- Headers of all source code files.

Each copyright holder must have their own copyright statement::

    Copyright (C) 2015-2019 CERN
    Copyright (C) 2019 Some company

**Copyright holders**

Each copyright holder **must** be a legal entity.

Copyright is tracked for non-trivial contributions (i.e. creative work). By
default we consider anything above 15 lines for a non-trivial contribution.
Examples for which we do not track copyright is e.g. fixing a typo or tiny
bug fixes.


```
Legal entity: A legal entity can be human (physical persons) or
non-human (juridical persons, e.g. corporations). A legal entity has
privileges and obligations such as being able to enter into contracts, to
sue or be sued. Thus, e.g. CERN is a legal entity but e.g. ATLAS, CMS and
CS3 Organization are not considered legal entities by the law.
```

**Maintainer responsibility**

Maintainers are responsible for asking each contributor who is the copyright
holder of a given contribution (often, it's the employer who holds the
copyright).

**Attribution**

Attribution is not tracked via copyright, but via the ``AUTHORS`` file.



Explicit agreement
------------------
**Contributions only via GitHub**

All contributions **MUST** be opened via pull requests on GitHub.

This way contributors have agreed to the [GitHub Terms of Use](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license),
which states :

```
"Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a
license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree
that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms."
```

This method avoid introducing either a Contributor License Agreement (CLAs) or
a Developer Certificate of Origin.
